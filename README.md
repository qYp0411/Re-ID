# 3C: Confidence-Guided Clustering and Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification

The *official* repository for [3C: Confidence-Guided Clustering and Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09464). We achieve state-of-the-art results: 86.7%/94.7%, 45.3%/73.1% and 47.1%/90.6% in terms of mAP/Rank-1 accuracy on Market-1501, the complex datasets MSMT17 and VeRi-776, respectively.
